Analysis of DataSet on Weather Condition.


To analyze weather data using Python and Pandas library to extract insights and identify patterns in weather conditions, including variability, visibility, pressure, and humidity, with the objective of understanding weather patterns and their impact on various weather conditions.


Insights-

* Identify the mean, standard deviation, and variance of weather parameters such as visibility, pressure, and humidity to understand their variability over time.
* Determine instances where data is missing for specific weather parameters and investigate potential reasons for missing data.
* Identify instances when wind speed exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 24), and visibility is low (e.g., 25), to detect potential extreme weather events.
* Analyze the mean values of weather parameters (such as visibility, pressure, humidity) against different weather conditions to understand their relationship and influence on weather conditions.
* Calculate the minimum and maximum values of weather parameters under different weather conditions to provide a statistical summary of weather conditions.
* Use the insights gained from the analysis to improve weather prediction models, enhance weather planning strategies, and better understand the impact of weather on various activities and industries.
